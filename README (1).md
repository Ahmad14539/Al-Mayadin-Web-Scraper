Webscrapping For Al-Mayadeen Website.

In this project I have used python codding language through pycharm platform inorder toscrap 10000 article from Al-Mayadeen Website.
I have installed 3 main libraries in pycharm to achieve this process are: lxml - requests - beautifulSoup4 
This will be the first task of the scrapping process, each jason file correspondes to articles scrapped from the same month.

To have a look on the work:
1. Install python on your laptop and set it up.
2. Install Pycharm application and set it up
3. Install these 3 libraries in pycharm after choosing python interpreter: lxml - requests - BeautifulSoup4

In the code file that you can see the full code for scrapping is shown where I have added 10 workers to complete the task fast using concurrent.futures.
Main sitemap url that I wanted to scrap was : https://www.almayadeen.net/sitemaps/all.xml
